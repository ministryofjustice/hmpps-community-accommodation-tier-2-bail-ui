      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Enforcement procedure</h2>
      <p>
      The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing the Public Sector Bodies 
      (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 (the ‘accessibility regulations’). 
      If you’re not happy with how we respond to your complaint, contact the <a href="https://www.equalityadvisoryservice.com" class="govuk-link">Equality Advisory and Support Service (EASS)</a>.

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Compliance status</h2>
      <p>
      This website is partially compliant with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.2 AA standard</a>, due to the non-compliances listed below.
      </p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Non-accessible content</h2>
      <p>
      The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.
      </p>
      <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
        <li>Some conditionally revealed input options are not announced by screen readers. This is not communicated via screen readers. This fails WCAG 2.2 success criterion 4.1.3 (AA) (Status Messages) and 4.1.2 (A) (Name, Role, Value). See known issues for <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/checkboxes/#known-issues">checkboxes</a> and <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/radios/#known-issues">radio buttons</a> in the GOV.UK Design System.</li>
        <li>When using NVDA, there is no visible focus indicator when items in the actions menu receive keyboard focus. This fails WCAG 2.2 success criterion 2.4.7 (AA) (Focus Visible). This has been raised with the Ministry of Justice design team.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What we’re doing to improve accessibility</h2>
      <p>We will continue to do internal audits to check the accessibility of this service, as well as taking feedback from users.</p>
      <p>Any changes required will be planned into our ongoing work on this service.</p>
