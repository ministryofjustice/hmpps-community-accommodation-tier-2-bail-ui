      <p>This accessibility statement applies to the Short-Term Accommodation (CAS-2) service, available at <a href="https://short-term-accommodation-cas-2.hmpps.service.justice.gov.uk">https://short-term-accommodation-cas-2.hmpps.service.justice.gov.uk.</a>

      <h2 class=govuk-heading-m>How you should be able to use this website</h2>

      <p>We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts using browser or device settings</li>
        <li>zoom in up to 400% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
        <li>navigate most of the website using a keyboard or speech recognition software</li>
        <li>listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We also make the website text as simple as possible to understand.</p>

        <li>some conditionally revealed inputs are not announced by screen readers</li>
        <li>some heading elements are not consistent</li>
        <li>some error message links do not shift focus for keyboard users</li>
        <li>some navigation links do not reflow on browser zoom</li>
        <li>some button labels are not consistent and descriptive enough</li>
        <li>some checkboxes and radio buttons are not linked to their context</li>
        <li>some documents in PDF format are not accessible</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Feedback, contact information and reporting accessibility problems with this website</h2>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Enforcement procedure</h2>
      <p>
      The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing the Public Sector Bodies 
      (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 (the ‘accessibility regulations’). 
      If you’re not happy with how we respond to your complaint, contact the <a href="https://www.equalityadvisoryservice.com" target="blank" class="govuk-link">Equality Advisory and Support Service (EASS)</a>.
      </p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Technical information about accessibility in this service</h2>
      <p>HMPPS is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018. </p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Compliance status</h2>
      <p>
      This website is partially compliant with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard</a>, due to the non-compliances listed below.
      </p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Non-accessible content</h2>
      <p>
      The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.
      </p>
      <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
        <li>Some conditionally revealed input options are not announced by screen readers. This is not communicated via screen readers. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.3.1 (Info and Relationships) and 4.1.2 (Name, Role, Value).</li>
        <li>Some error message links do not shift focus to the error field. This creates an unequal experience for keyboard users, as they can’t directly jump to the fields as intended. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.3.1 (Info and Relationships), 1.3.2 (Meaningful Sequence) and 2.4.3 (Focus Order).</li>
        <li>Some page headings are not semantically coded as such in the HTML meaning screen reader users do not receive the same cues. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.3.1 (Info and Relationships).</li>
        <li>Some page heading structures do not accurately reflect the visual hierarchy and are not intuitive. Inaccurate heading hierarchy can lead to confusion and difficulty in navigating the page with screen readers. This also impacts related PDFs. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.3.1 (Info and Relationships).</li>
        <li>Some navigation links do not reflow properly on browser zoom. This reflow behaviour presents significant challenges for users with visual impairments or those who rely on magnification software. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.4.10 (Reflow)</li>
        <li>Some checkboxes and radio buttons are not linked to their context. As a result, screen reader users navigating to the checkboxes are not informed of the main purpose of them. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.3.1 (Info and Relationships) and 3.3.2 (Labels or Instructions).</li>
        <li>Some button labels are not consistent and descriptive enough. The inconsistency in naming and lack of specificity in the labels could cause confusion comprehending the content, particularly for those with certain cognitive and learning difficulties. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.4.6 (Headings and Labels).</li>
        <li>The “Back to Top” link does not programmatically shift keyboard focus. This prevents keyboard users from engaging with the link as intended. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.3.1 (Info and Relationships), 1.3.2 (Meaningful Sequence) and 2.4.3 (Focus Order).</li>
        <li>PDF Title text does not meet contrast ratio requirements. The low contrast could result in users finding it difficult to read the text, especially those with visual impairments including low vision and colour blindness. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.4.3 (Contrast).</li>
        <li>PDF Change links display with full URLs. This formatting requires keyboard users to tab through each line of the link separately. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.3.1 (Info and Relationships) and 2.4.4 (Link Purpose).</li>
        <li>PDF Navigation jump-links display in broken lines. This causes screen readers to announce each segment of the link as a separate link as users tab through the document. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.3.1 (Info and Relationships) and 2.4.4 (Link Purpose).</li>
      </ol>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What we’re doing to improve accessibility</h2>
      <p>We will continue to do internal audits to check the accessibility of this service, as well as taking feedback from users.</p>
